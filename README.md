# Project-SolidAlpha
Algorithm Visualization (Algo-Visualizer) is an online interactive platform that visualizes algorithm from code. The project illustrates how algorithms work in a graphical way. It mainly aims to simplify and deepen the understanding of algorithms operation.

In this project, I present an algorithm visualizing that allows the user to browse and interacts with
different sorting and comparison algorithms.
